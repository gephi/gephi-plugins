Panel3.jTextArea1.text=Example:\nLet's imagine you selected "authors" for agents in the previous screen. Suppose that the field for "authors" is made of several co-authors, separated by semicolon.\n=> Please choose "semicolon" as a delimiter.\n(leave the selection empty if no delimiter applies).
Panel3.jLabelSecondAgentAlso.text=Is this field made of subfields? If so, what is the delimiter?

Panel2.jLabel5.text=Example: for a network of co-authors, pick the field of co-authors twice!
Panel2.jLabel3.text=is connected to
Panel2.jLabel2.text=1.  This type of agent:
Panel2.jLabel1.text=What are the connections made of?
Panel2.jLabel4.text=2. This type of agent:

Panel6.jLabel2.text=A network will be created, where:
Panel5.jCheckBoxInnerLinks.text=create links between jLabel3 themselves, and between jLabel5 themselves
Panel5.jCheckBoxSelfLoops.text=remove self-loops: when an agent is connected to itself.
Panel5.jCheckBoxRemoveDuplicates.text=remove duplicates: lines that have exactly the same values for both types of agents will be removed
Panel4.jLabel3.text=If you want to create a dynamic network, where is the field for time?
Panel4.jTextArea1.text=Let's imagine you each of your data entry has a time stamp. You could create a network changing in time, where nodes and their connections appear and disappear along a timeline.\n2 time formats allowed: 1984, 2014-09-17 (but not 2014-17-09).\nDates (1984) but also durations (1984,1986) are allowed in this field.  For duration, use the comma to separate the start and end dates.
