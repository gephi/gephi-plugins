msgstr "Tuning"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.behavior"
msgstr "Behavior Alternatives"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.performance"
msgstr "Performance"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.threads"
msgstr "Threads"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.scalingRatio.name"
msgstr "Scaling"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.scalingRatio.desc"
msgstr "How much repulsion you want. More makes a more sparse graph."

msgid "ForceAtlas2.gravity.name"
msgstr "Gravity"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.gravity.desc"
msgstr "Attracts nodes to the center. Prevents islands from drifting away."

msgid "ForceAtlas2.strongGravityMode.name"
msgstr "Stronger Gravity"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.strongGravityMode.desc"
msgstr "A stronger gravity law"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.distributedAttraction.name"
msgstr "Dissuade Hubs"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.distributedAttraction.desc"
msgstr ""
"Distributes attraction along outbound edges. Hubs attract less and thus are "
"pushed to the borders."

msgid "ForceAtlas2.linLogMode.name"
msgstr "LinLog mode"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.linLogMode.desc"
msgstr ""
"Switch ForceAtlas' model from lin-lin to lin-log (tribute to Andreas Noack). "
"Makes clusters more tight."

msgid "ForceAtlas2.adjustSizes.name"
msgstr "Prevent Overlap"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.adjustSizes.desc"
msgstr ""
"Use only when spatialized. Should not be used with \"Approximate Repulsion\""

msgid "ForceAtlas2.jitterTolerance.name"
msgstr "Tolerance (speed)"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.jitterTolerance.desc"
msgstr ""
"How much swinging you allow. Above 1 discouraged. Lower gives less speed and "
"more precision."

msgid "ForceAtlas2.barnesHutOptimization.name"
msgstr "Approximate Repulsion"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.barnesHutOptimization.desc"
msgstr ""
"Barnes Hut optimization: n complexity to n.ln(n) ; allows larger graphs."

msgid "ForceAtlas2.barnesHutTheta.name"
msgstr "Approximation"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.barnesHutTheta.desc"
msgstr "Theta of the Barnes Hut optimization."

msgid "ForceAtlas2.edgeWeightInfluence.name"
msgstr "Edge Weight Influence"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.edgeWeightInfluence.desc"
msgstr ""
"How much influence you give to the edges weight. 0 is \"no influence\" and 1 "
"is \"normal\"."

msgid "ForceAtlas2.threads.name"
msgstr "Threads number"

msgid "ForceAtlas2.threads.desc"
msgstr "More threads means more speed if your cores can handle it."
