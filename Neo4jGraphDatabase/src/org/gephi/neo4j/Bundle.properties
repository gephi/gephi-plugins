    <p>Neo4j is an open-source graph database. \
    It is a fully transactional Java persistence engine that stores data structured in graphs rather than in tables.\
    </p>\n\n<p>This plug-in allows to pull and visualize graphs stored in a Neo4j database easily. \
    It can also push back any graph to Neo4j, regardless where they come from.\
    </p>\n\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul><li>Pull complete graph, or by setting a traversal</li>\n<li>Filter, keep only nodes/edges with particular property values</li>\n<li>Export graph to Neo4j</li>\n<li>Remote connection</li>\n<li>Debug traversal on the visualization</li></ul>\n\n<h3>Version</h3>\n<p>The plug-in supports Neo4j 1.1. \
    Check out <a href="http://neo4j.org">neo4j.org</a> for details. \
    You don't need to download the Neo4j library to use this plug-in.\
