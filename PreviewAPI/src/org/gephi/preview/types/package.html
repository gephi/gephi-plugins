        Additional property types.
        <p>
            Properties values are traditionally basic types like Float or String.
            This package defines additional property types which can be used by renderers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every new type should also define a <code>PropertyEditor</code> to
            provide serialization and cutom UI components to edit the value.
            Example are provided in the <code>org.gephi.desktop.preview.propertyeditors</code>
            package.
