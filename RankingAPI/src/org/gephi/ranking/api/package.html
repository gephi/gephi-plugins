        Ranking API
        <p>
            Provides built-in ranking and transformers to apply to the current
            workspace. For instance for nodes, ranking can be the degree of the 
            node or a numerical value like an 'age' or 'duration'. By default, the
            <code>RankingModel</code> have 'Degree', 'InDegree', 'OutDegree' and
            one ranking per numerical attribute. Ranking exists for both nodes and
            edges and these are called element types.

            See the <code>org.gephi.ranking.spi</code> package to know how to
            implement new ranking or transformer builders.
