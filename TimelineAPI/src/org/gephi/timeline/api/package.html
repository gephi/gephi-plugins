        API which controls the Timeline, the UI component which allows network
        exploration over time.
        <p>
            The Timeline API allows to set custom bounds and visible interval. The
            timeline is the UI component which controls the network exploration
            over time. It is connected to the <code>DynamicAPI</code> which
            controls the time scale and intervals. The API also allows to
            control the animation (i.e play feature).

        <p>
            The <code>TimelineController</code> is managing models (one per workspace)
            and is the access door to the system. This controller is a service, and can be
            retrieved by using the following command:
        </p>
        <p><code>TimelineController tc = Lookup.getDefault().lookup(TimelineController.class);</code></p>
