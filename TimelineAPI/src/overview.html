        Timeline API provides access to the timeline data, control settings and
        animation.
        <p>
            The Timeline API allows to set custom bounds and visible interval. The
            timeline is the UI component which controls the network exploration
            over time. It is connected to the <code>DynamicAPI</code> which
            controls the time scale and intervals. The API also allows to
            control the animation (i.e play feature).
