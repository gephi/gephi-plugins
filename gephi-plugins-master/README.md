# Gephi Plugins

This repository is an out-of-the-box development environment for Gephi plugins. Gephi plugins are implemented in Java and can extend [Gephi](https://gephi.org) in many different ways, adding or improving features. Getting started is easy with this repository but also checkout the [Bootcamp](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-plugins-bootcamp) for examples of plugins you can create. 

## Migrate Gephi 0.8 plugins

The process in which plugins are developed and submitted had an overhaul when Gephi 0.9 was released. Details can be read on this article: [Plugin development gets new tools and opens-up to the community](https://gephi.wordpress.com/2015/12/16/plugin-development-gets-new-tools-and-opens-up-to-the-community/).

This section is a step-by-step guide to migrate 0.8 plugins. Before going through the code and configuration, let's summerize the key differences between the two environements.

- The 0.8 base is built using Ant, whereas the 0.9 uses Maven. These two are significantly different. If you aren't familiar with Maven, you can start with [Maven in 5 Minutes]( https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html). Maven configurations are defined in the `pom.xml` files.
- The 0.8 base finds the Gephi modules into the `platform` folder checked in the repository, whereas the 0.9 base downloads everything from the central Maven repository, where all Gephi modules are available.
- Maven requires to separate source files (e.g. .java) and resources files (e.g. .properties) into distinct folders. Sources are located in `src/main/java` and resources in `src/main/resources`.

A custom `migrate` goal is available in the [Gephi Maven Plugin](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-maven-plugin) to facilitate the migration from 0.8 to 0.9. This automated process migrates ant-based plugins to maven and takes care of copying the configuration and code. Follow these steps to migrate your plugin:

- Fork and checkout this repository:

        git clone git@github.com:username/gephi-plugins.git

If you've already had a forked repository based on 0.8 we suggest to save your code somewhere, delete it and fork again as the history was cleared.

- Copy your plugin folder at the root of this directory.

- Run this command:

        mvn org.gephi:gephi-maven-plugin:migrate

This command will detect the ant-based plugin and migrate it. The resulting folder is then located into the `modules` folder.

The plugin code can then be inspected in Netbeans or built via command line with `mvn clean package`.

## Get started

### Requirements

Developing Gephi plugins requires [JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or later and [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). Although any IDE/Editor can be used, [Netbeans IDE](https://netbeans.org/) is recommend as Gephi itself is based on [Netbeans Platform](https://netbeans.org/features/platform/index.html).

### Create a plugin

The creation of a new plugin is simple thanks to our custom [Gephi Maven Plugin](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-maven-plugin). The `generate` goal asks a few questions and then configures everything for you.

- Fork and checkout the latest version of this repository:

        git clone git@github.com:username/gephi-plugins.git
- Run the following command and answer the questions:

        mvn org.gephi:gephi-maven-plugin:generate

This is an example of what this process will ask:

        Name of organization (e.g. my.company): org.foo
        Name of artifact (e.g my-plugin): my-plugin
        Version (e.g. 1.0.0): 1.0.0
        Directory name (e.g MyPlugin): MyPlugin
        Branding name (e.g My Plugin): My Plugin
        Category (e.g Layout, Filter, etc.): Layout
        Author: My Name
        Author email (optional):
        Author URL (optional):
        License (e.g Apache 2.0): Apache 2.0
        Short description (i.e. one sentence): Plugin catch-phrase
        Long description (i.e multiple sentences): Plugin features are great
        Would you like to add a README.md file (yes|no): yes

The plugin configuration is created. Now you can (in any order):

- Add some Java code in the `src/main/java` folder of your plugin
- Add some resources (e.g. Bundle.properties, images) into the `src/main/resources/` folder of your plugin
- Change the version, author or license information into the `pom.xml` file, which is in your plugin folder
- Edit the description or category details into the `src/main/nbm/manifest.mf` file in your plugin folder 

### Build a plugin

Run the following command to compile and build your plugin:

       mvn clean package

In addition of compiling and building the JAR and NBM, this command uses the `Gephi Maven Plugin` to verify the plugin's configuration. In care something is wrong it will fail and indicte the reason.

### Run Gephi with plugin

Run the following command to run Gephi with your plugin pre-installed. Make sure to run `mvn package` beforehand to rebuild.

       mvn org.gephi:gephi-maven-plugin:run

In Gephi, when you navigate to `Tools` > `Plugins` you should see your plugin listed in `Installed`.

## Submit a plugin

Submitting a Gephi plugin for approval is a simple process based on GitHub's [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) mechanism.

- First, make sure you're working on a fork of [gephi-plugins](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-plugins). You can check that by running `git remote -v` and look at the url, it should contain your GitHub username, for example `git@github.com:username/gephi-plugins.git`.

- Add and commit your work. It's recommended to keep your fork synced with the upstream repository, as explained [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/), so you can run `git merge upstream/master` beforehand.

- Push your commits to your fork with `git push origin master`.

- Navigate to your fork's URL and create a pull request. Select `master-forge` instead of `master` as base branch.

- Submit your pull request.

## Update a plugin

Updating a Gephi plugin has the same process as submiting it for the first time. Don't forget to merge from upstream's master branch.

## IDE Support

### Netbeans IDE

- Start Netbeans and go to `File` and then `Open Project`. Navigate to your fork repository, Netbeans automatically recognizes it as Maven project. 
- Each plugin module can be found in the `Modules` folder.

To run Gephi with your plugin pre-installed, right click on the `gephi-plugins` project and select `Run`.

To debug Gephi with your plugin, right click on the `gephi-plugins` project and select `Debug`.

### IntelliJ IDEA

- Start IntelliJ and `Open` the project by navigating to your fork repository. IntelliJ may prompt you to import the Maven project, select yes.

To run Gephi with your plugin pre-installed when you click `Run`, create a `Maven` run configuration and enter `org.gephi:gephi-maven-plugin:run` in the command field. The working directory is simply the current project directory.

To debug Gephi with your plugin, create a `Remote` configuration and switch the `Debugger mode` option to `Listen`. Then create a `Maven` run configuration like abobe but add `-Drun.params.debug="-J-Xdebug -J-Xnoagent -J-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,suspend=n,server=n,address=5005"` into the `Runner` > `VM Options` field. Then, go to the `Run` menu and first run debug with the remote configuration and then only run debug with the Maven configuration.

## FAQ

#### What kind of plugins can I create?

Gephi can be extended in many ways but the major categories are `Layout`, `Export`, `Import`, `Data Laboratory`, `Filter`, `Generator`, `Metric`, `Preview`, `Tool`, `Appearance` and `Clustering`. A good way to start is to look at examples with the [bootcamp](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-plugins-bootcamp).

#### In which language can plugins be created?

Plugins can use any JVM languages (e.g. Scala, Python, Groovy) but the default option is Java. 

#### Can native libraries be used?

Yes, native libraries can be used in modules.

#### How is this repository structured?

The `modules` folder is where plugin modules go. Each plugin is defined in a single folder in this directory. A plugin can be composed of multiple modules (it's called a suite then) but usually one is enough to do what you want.

The `pom.xml` file in `modules` is the parent pom for plugins. A Maven pom can inherit configurations from a parent and that is something we use to keep each plugin's pom very simple. Notice that each plugin's pom (i.e. the `pom.xml` file in the plugin folder) has a `<parent>` defined.

The `pom.xml` file at the root folder makes everything fit together and notably lists the modules.

#### How are the manifest settings defined?

There are two options. The first option is what the `generate` task does: it puts entries `OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description`, `OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description`, `OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category` and `OpenIDE-Module-Name` into the `src/main/nbm/manifest.mf` file. The second option sets a `OpenIDE-Module-Localizing-Bundle` entry into the `manifest.mf` so values are defined elsewhere in `Bundle.properties` file. The value is then simply the path to the file (e.g. `OpenIDE-Module-Localizing-Bundle: org/project/Bundle.properties`).

The second option is preferable when the short or long description have too many characters as the manifest format is pretty restrictive.  

#### How to add a new module?

This applies for suite plugins with multiple modules. Besides creating the module folder, edit the `pom.xml` file and add the folder path to `<modules>`, like in this example:

```
    <!-- List of modules -->
    <modules>
        <!-- Add here the paths of all modules (e.g. <module>modules/MyModule</module>) -->
        <module>modules/ExampleModule</module> 
    </modules>
```

#### Where are dependencies configured?

Dependencies are configured in the `<dependencies>` section in the plugin folder's `pom.xml`. Each dependency has a `groupId`, an `artifactId` and a `version`. There are three types of dependencies a plugin can have: an external library, a Gephi module or a Netbeans module.

The list of Gephi and Netbeans dependencies one can use can be found in the `modules/pom.xml` file. All possible dependencies are listed in the `<dependencyManagement>` section. Because each plugin module inherits from this parent pom the version can be omitted when the dependency is set. For instance, this is how a plugin depends on `GraphAPI` and Netbeans's `Lookup`.

```
<dependencies>
     <dependency>
         <groupId>org.netbeans.api</groupId>
         <artifactId>org-openide-util-lookup</artifactId>
     </dependency>
     <dependency>
         <groupId>org.gephi</groupId>
         <artifactId>graph-api</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### What are public packages for?

This applies for suite plugins with multiple modules. A module should declare the packages it wants to make accessible to other modules. For instance, if a module `B` depends on the class `my.org.project.ExampleController` defined in a module `A`, the `A` module should declare `my.org.project` as public package.

Public packages are configured in the module's `pom.xml` file. Edit the `<publicPackages>` entry. Example:

```
<publicPackages>
    <publicPackage>my.org.project</publicPackage>
</publicPackages>
```

#### What is the difference between plugin and module?

It's the same thing. We say module because Gephi is a modular application and is composed of many independent modules. Plugins also are modules but we call them plugin because they aren't in the _core_ Gephi.

#### When running the plugin in Netbeans I get an error "Running standalone modules or suites requires..."

This error appears when you try to run a module. To run Gephi with your plugin you need to run the `gephi-plugins` project, not your module.
