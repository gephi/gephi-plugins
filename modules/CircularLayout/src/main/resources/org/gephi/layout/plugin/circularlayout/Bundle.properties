OpenIDE-Module-Name=Circular Layout
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=This plugin provides three circular layouts; one simple circle (titled "Circular Layout", one is a dual circle layout (titled "Dual Circle Layout"), and the third is a grouped layout with radial axes (title "Radial Axis Layout").
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
This plugin contains three separate circular layouts: "Circular Layout", "Dual Circle Layout", and the "Radial Axis Layout".\
<h3>Circular Layout</h3>\
<p>The Circular Layout draws nodes in a circle and offers the following options:\
<ul><li>Order nodes by Node ID.</li>\
<li>Order nodes in random order.</li>\
<li>Order nodes by degree, in degree, out degree, etc.</li>\
<li>Order nodes by attribute sort (based on data type of attribute).</li>\
<li>Allows drawing node order on circle either clockwise or counter-clockwise.</li>\
<li>By default scales circle to prevent node overlap.</li>\
<li>Allows a user entered fixed circle size.</li>\
</ul>\
<br />\
</p>\
<h3>Dual Circle Layout</h3>\
<p>The Dual Circle Layout draws nodes on two circles.  By default it draws the top four "high degree" nodes on an internal circle, with the remaining nodes on an external circle.<br />\
It offers the following options:\
<ul><li>Order nodes by degree, in degree, out degree, etc.</li>\
<li>Order nodes by attribute sort (based on data type of attribute).</li>\
<li>Allows placing "high" nodes on inside or outside circle.</li>\
<li>Allows setting number of "high" nodes to use on second circle.</li>\
<li>Allows drawing node order on circle either clockwise or counter-clockwise.</li>\
<li>By default scales circle to prevent node overlap.</li>\
</ul>\
</p>\
<h3>Radial Axis Layout</h3>\
<p>The Radial Axis Layout groups nodes and draws the groups in axes (or spars) radiating outwards from a central circle.<br />\
It offers the following options:\
<ul><li>Group nodes by degree, in degree, out degree, etc.</li>\
<li>Group nodes by attribute sort (based on data type of attribute).</li>\
<li>Draw axes/spars in ascending or descending order.</li>\
<li>Allows top, middle or bottom "knockdown" of axes/spars, along with ability to specify number of spars resulting after knockdown.</li>\
<li>Allows drawing in either clockwise or counter-clockwise.</li>\
<li>By default this layout tries to prevent node overlap but may fail in certain instances.</li>\
<li>Allows tuning of spacing between nodes to allow an easy way to overcome overlap issues.</li>\
<li>Allows uniform resize of nodes.</li>\
</ul>\
</p>
