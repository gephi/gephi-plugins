OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This plugin exports networks with geographic dimensions to a KMZ file, which can be opened in Google Earth.\n\n\
    The tool will attempt to guess which columns contain geodata. Columns can also be specified by clicking the \u201cOptions\u201d button in the file selection window.\n\n\
    ExportToEarth was developed during the NEH Summer Institute for Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities on Digital Cultural Mapping (http://hypercities.com/NEH/) at UCLA. \
    Thanks to Ryan Cordell, Zoe Borovsky, and Paula Lupkin for being the impetus behind its development, not to mention the alpha testers.
