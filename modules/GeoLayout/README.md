## Introduction

A Gephi plugin to display your geocoded graphs.

## Plugin Owner’s Notes

This plugin contains only a layout (“GeoLayout”) to display your graph according to geocoded attributes. To use it:

1. Select the two attributes which contain the geocoded coordinates of your nodes (latitude and longitude)
2. Select the projection you want to use
3. Set the other parameters according to the selected projection
4. Launch the algorithm

The available projections are:

* [Mercator](http://bit.ly/JQuvw)
* [Tranverse Mercator](http://bit.ly/btWRTI)
* [Miller cylindrical](http://bit.ly/agJOxd)
* [Gall-Peters](http://bit.ly/Nj5cW)
* [Sinusoidal](http://bit.ly/a8SsNg)
* [Lambert cylindrical](http://bit.ly/cnuxqr)
* [Winkel Tripel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winkel_tripel_projection)
* [Equirectangular](http://bit.ly/vxEmy)

For any questions or just more information, you can check the related [thread](http://bit.ly/a6itGZ) on the Gephi forum.

And if, for any reason, some of your nodes do not have valid values on the selected attributes (for latitude and longitude), they will be displayed on a line on the bottom of your graph (then, you can delete them or do what you want). Also make sure your latitude and longitude columns are of type 'double', not 'string'.
