    This plugin tries to find an edge attribute with "color" or "colour" in its name. \
    Then it reads RGB of #hex values in this attribute and colors edges accordingly.\n\n\
    <h3>When is it useful?\
    </h3>\nThis plugin gives you full control on the color of your edges in Gephi. \
    Define the color for each edge as an attribute, that's it!\n\n\
