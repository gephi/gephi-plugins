OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=MultiGravity ForceAtlas 2. Nodes are expected to have an attribute which is "gravity_x" and "gravity_y" which need to be numbers, that give approximate locations of sources of gravity. The distance between the sources of gravity can be modified using the parameters for the layout. The main benefit of this algorithm is that graphs can be coerced into certain shapes based on some data related to the data set.


ForceAtlas2.name=MultiGravity ForceAtlas 2
ForceAtlas2.description=Quality layout: a linear-attraction linear-repulsion model with few approximations (BarnesHut). Speed automatically computed. Nodes are expected to have an attribute which is "gravity_x" and "gravity_y" which need to be numbers.

ForceAtlas2.tuning=Tuning
ForceAtlas2.behavior=Behavior Alternatives
ForceAtlas2.performance=Performance
ForceAtlas2.threads=Threads

ForceAtlas2.scalingRatio.name=Scaling
ForceAtlas2.scalingRatio.desc=How much repulsion you want. More makes a more sparse graph.
ForceAtlas2.gravityXRatio.name=GravityX Scaling
ForceAtlas2.gravityXRatio.desc=How much distance you want between points of gravity (X)
ForceAtlas2.gravityYRatio.name=GravityY Scaling
ForceAtlas2.gravityYRatio.desc=How much distance you want between points of gravity (Y)
ForceAtlas2.gravity.name=Gravity
ForceAtlas2.gravity.desc=Attracts nodes to the center. Prevents islands from drifting away.
ForceAtlas2.strongGravityMode.name=Stronger Gravity
ForceAtlas2.strongGravityMode.desc=A stronger gravity law
ForceAtlas2.distributedAttraction.name=Dissuade Hubs
ForceAtlas2.distributedAttraction.desc=Distributes attraction along outbound edges. Hubs attract less and thus are pushed to the borders.
ForceAtlas2.linLogMode.name=LinLog mode
ForceAtlas2.linLogMode.desc=Switch ForceAtlas' model from lin-lin to lin-log (tribute to Andreas Noack). Makes clusters more tight.
ForceAtlas2.adjustSizes.name=Prevent Overlap
ForceAtlas2.adjustSizes.desc=Use only when spatialized. Should not be used with "Approximate Repulsion"
ForceAtlas2.jitterTolerance.name=Tolerance (speed)
ForceAtlas2.jitterTolerance.desc=How much swinging you allow. Above 1 discouraged. Lower gives less speed and more precision.
ForceAtlas2.barnesHutOptimization.name=Approximate Repulsion
ForceAtlas2.barnesHutOptimization.desc=Barnes Hut optimization: n\u00b2 complexity to n.ln(n) ; allows larger graphs.
ForceAtlas2.barnesHutTheta.name=Approximation
ForceAtlas2.barnesHutTheta.desc=Theta of the Barnes Hut optimization.
ForceAtlas2.edgeWeightInfluence.name=Edge Weight Influence
ForceAtlas2.edgeWeightInfluence.desc=How much influence you give to the edges weight. 0 is "no influence" and 1 is "normal".
ForceAtlas2.threads.name=Threads number
ForceAtlas2.threads.desc=More threads means more speed if your cores can handle it.
