OpenIDE-Module-Name: Hairball Buster
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description: Implementation of Hairball Buster Graph Analytic Triage Approach for Gephi.
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description: Hairball Buster (HB) (also called node-neighbor centrality or NNC) is an approach to graph analytic triage that uses simple calculations and visualization to quickly understand and compare graphs. Rather than displaying highly interconnected graphs as `hairballs' that are difficult to understand, HB provides a simple standard visual representation of a graph and its metrics.
