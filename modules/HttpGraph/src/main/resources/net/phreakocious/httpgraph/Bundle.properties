OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    <br />\nThis plugin runs a proxy server in Java and collects data from your web browsing to generate a graph of the web. \
    <br />\n<br />\nAll you have to do is configure the proxy setting in your browser for http://127.0.0.1:8088 (or a port of your choosing) <br />\n<br />\n** Don't forget to disable this browser setting when<br />\n** you're done or your browing won't work! \
    <br />\n<br />\nProxy functionality provided by Membrane ESB - http://membrane-soa.org/esb/<br />\nA video that shows how this works is available on Vimeo - http://vimeo.com/18591468<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks to @kutsalb for his patience and repeated educational floggings.  \
    Retraining a perl apologist in Java is no trivial task!\

HttpGraphPanel.jTextArea1.text=This plugin works best when used with the HTTP Graph \nCollector extension for Google Chrome.  An HTTP server \nwith a REST endpoint will be listening on localhost:65444 \nfor data from the Chrome extension. \n\nUsing this as a proxy works, but is not recommended \nanymore.  With the vast majority of sites now being served \nvia HTTPS, very little data can be collected in this way.\n\nFor more information, check the buttons below.
