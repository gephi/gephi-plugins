OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    <br />\nThis plugin runs a proxy server in Java and collects data from your web browsing to generate a graph of the web. \
    <br />\n<br />\nAll you have to do is configure the proxy setting in your browser for http://127.0.0.1:8088 (or a port of your choosing) <br />\n<br />\n** Don't forget to disable this browser setting when<br />\n** you're done or your browing won't work! \
    <br />\n<br />\nProxy functionality provided by Membrane ESB - http://membrane-soa.org/esb/<br />\nA video that shows how this works is available on Vimeo - http://vimeo.com/18591468<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks to @kutsalb for his patience and repeated educational floggings.  \
    Retraining a perl apologist in Java is no trivial task!\

HttpGraphPanel.jTextArea1.text=This plugin works best when used with the HTTP Graph\nCollector extension for Google Chrome.  An HTTP server\nwith a REST endpoint will be listening on localhost:65444 \nfor data from the Chrome extension.  Using this as a \nproxy is not recommended anymore.\n\nFor more information, check the buttons below.
