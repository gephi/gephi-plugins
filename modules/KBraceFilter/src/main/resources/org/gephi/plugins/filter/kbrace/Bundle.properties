OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>The k-brace filter is a variant of the k-core. Instead of the degree it uses the edge\u2019s embededness (number of common neighbors). It is useful to highlight dense connected components in social networks. The filter works only on undirected graphs. As defined in the paper \u201cthe k-brace of a graph is the subgraph formed by repeatedly deleting all edges of embeddedness less than k and then deleting all single-node connected components\u201d</p>\n<h3>Plugin Owner\u2019s Notes</h3>\n<p>Reference: Structural diversity in social contagion Johan Ugander, Lars Backstrom, Cameron Marlow, and Jon Kleinberg PNAS (2012)<br>\n<a title=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/03/27/1116502109.full.pdf\" href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/03/27/1116502109.full.pdf\">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/03/27/1116502109.full.pdf</a></p>
OpenIDE-Module-Name=KBrace Filter

KBraceFilter.name = K-brace
KBraceFilter.description = Recursively deletes edges which both nodes have less than K common neighbors. Also removes all isolates.
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=K-brace filter which removes less embedded edges
