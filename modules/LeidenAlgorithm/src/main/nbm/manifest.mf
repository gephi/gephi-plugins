OpenIDE-Module-Name: Leiden Algorithm
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description: The Leiden algorithm finds well-connected communities in large scale networks.
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description: The Leiden algorithm finds well-connected communities and is very fast. It provides several guarantees about the connectivity of commmunities. This implementation can optimize both CPM and Modularity.
