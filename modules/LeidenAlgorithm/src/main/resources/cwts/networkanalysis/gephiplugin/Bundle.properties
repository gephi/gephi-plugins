RunClusteringPanel.checkBoxUseEdgeWeights.toolTipText=<html>\n<p width="300">\nTake into account the edge weights in the clustering. If this is not done, each edge is assumed to have a default weight of 1.0. For graphs with multiple edges or dynamic edges, the edge multiplicity is taken into account when the weights are not considered.\n</p>\n</html>
RunClusteringPanel.textFieldNRestarts.toolTipText=<html>\n\n<p width="300">\nThe algorithm is restarted the indicated number of times. Each restart uses a different random seed, and so may result in different clusterings. The clustering with the highest quality is returned.\n</p>\n\n</html>
RunClusteringPanel.checkBoxRandomSeed.toolTipText=<html>\n\n<p width="300">\nIndicated whether the seed for the random number generator should itself be random. If this is selected, the results may be different when rerun.\n</p>\n\n</html>
RunClusteringPanel.comboBoxQualityFunction.toolTipText=<html>\n\n<p width="300">\nThe quality function that is optimized by the algorithm. \n</p>\n<br>\n<p width="300">\nThe Constant Potts Model (CPM) is a quality function that is in a sense scale invariant: its definition of what a community is does not depend on the graph in question. The communities have a (uniform) internal density of at least the indicated resolution, and communities are separeted by a density that is at most the indicated resolution. The resolution can therefore be interpreted as the desired density of the communities.\n</p>\n<br>\n<p width="300">\nModularity is a quality function that takes into account the network, and in particular, the degree of nodes. It is relatively easy to use, as the "default" resolution of 1 often seems to yield reasonable results. However, modularity may incorrectly group clusters together that ordinarily should be separate, known as the resolution limit. CPM does not suffer from this problem.\n</p>\n\n</html>
RunClusteringPanel.comboBoxAlgorithm.toolTipText=<html>\n<p width="300">\nThe algorithm used for optimization. The Leiden algorithm is generally recommended as it is faster and yields higher quality partitions than the Louvain algorithm. The Louvain algorithm is included for completeness.\n</p>\n</html>
RunClusteringPanel.textFieldResolution.toolTipText=<html>\n\n<p width="300">\nThe resolution determines the granularity of the clustering. The higher the resolution, the more granular the clustering, resulting in smaller communities. The lower the resolution, the less granular the clustering, resulting in larger communities.\n</p>\n<br>\n<p width="300">\nFor CPM, resolutions of interest can be very low, even as low as 1e-6 or even lower. For Modularity, resolutions around 1 tend to be of interest.\n</p>\n\n</html>
RunClusteringPanel.textFieldNIterations.toolTipText=<html>\n\n<p width="300">\nThe algorithm will be iterated the indicated number of times. The result of a single iteration is used as the input for the next iteration.\n</p>\n\n</html>
RunClusteringPanel.textFieldSeed.toolTipText=<html>\n\n<p width="300">\nThe random seed that is used to initialize the algorithm. The indicated seed will only be used if the seed is not set to be random itself.\n</p>\n\n</html>
