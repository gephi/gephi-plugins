OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This plugin finds all the ancestors and descendants of an input node for a directed graph. \
    The user has to identify the input node with the node's Id value (not the label value). \
    The origin node, as well as its ancestors and descendants are reported in a variable called "Lineage" (see data laboratory). \
    When a node is both an ancestor and a descendant, it is marked as a Hybrid and stored that way in the "Lineage" column. \
    The plugin also adds three boolean variables that mark for each node whether they are the origin node, an ancestor, or a descendant. \
    Finally, for two columns are added to report the distance of each ancestor (negative values) and each descendant (positive values). \
    All unrelated nodes have a distance of 0 and should be ignored.
