OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=<h2>Description</h2> \
 <p>This plugin performs a Multidimensional Scaling Analysis, using the Stress Minimization algorithm included in the MDSJ library. \
 The MDSJ library was created by Algorithmics Group of the University of Konstanz (see reference below). \
 The MDSJ library was made available under the Creative Commons License "by-nc-sa" 3.0. The license is available at \
 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/.</p> \
 <p>The plugin uses path distances between nodes as input for the Multidimensional Scaling analysis, and it assigns geometric \
 coordinates to the nodes in such a way that nodes with shorter path distances are close together and nodes with longer \
 path distances are far apart. The plugin also reports a stress value that indicates the fit of the configuration. \
 The lower the stress, the better the configuration represents that actual path distances between the nodes. \
 A weight matrix is used to determine how much the distance between any pair of nodes contributes to stress \
 (weight[i][j]  = distance[i][j]^exponent). In the default setting, no weighting of the distances occurs (all distances are treated equally). \
 It is also possible to downweigh large distances and upweigh small distances (an exponent of -2 is used). \
 According to the authors of the MDSJ library this is the more common choice. </p> \
 <p>Optionally, edge weights can be interpreted by the plugin as representing distances / dissimilarities or proximities / similarities. \
 In that case the distances between nodes will be based on the edge weights (which are first normalized to values from 1 to 2). \
 These options will not make sense for all applications, and the plugin will in some cases return missing values. </p> \
 The plugin produces coordinates on up to 10 dimensions (to be selected by the user) and assigns these to the nodes in the \
 nodes list (see the data laboratory). The coordinates can then be used by the MDS_Layout plugin (needs to be downloaded separately). </p> \
 <p> The direction of edges/paths is currently ignored. \
 With directed paths the resulting MDS configuration typically has a lot of overlapping nodes. </p> \
