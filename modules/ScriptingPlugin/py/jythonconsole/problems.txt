Known problems
==========================

You must use the keyboard not the mouse to select methods.  (Due to focus problems.)

Builtin types don't work like they do in PyCrust.  This is because they have a null __doc__ string in Jython.

Sometimes introspect.getAllAttributeNames goes into an infine recursive loop

python.security.respectJavaAccessibility must be set to true in Jython's registry (this is the default setting)
