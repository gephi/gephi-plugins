OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    <p>This plugin allows users to filter the graph by providing a text file with the list of node labels they want to keep. \
    To run it go to the Filters section and select Attributes > Filter by list by double-clicking or dragging it to the Queries area.</p> \
    <p>The filter allows you to select a text file (*.txt) from your hard drive and use it as a list of the nodes to be kept. \
    The text shall contain one node label per line.</p> \
    <p>Any line that isn't a label will not be taken into account. \
    If you wish to keep also the neighbors of the nodes belonging to the list, then check the option "Include neighbors". \
    This will keep all the nodes that are connected to the nodes in the text file via incoming or outgoing edges.</p>
